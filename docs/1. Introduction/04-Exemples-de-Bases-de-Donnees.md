# Examples of Databases in Different Contexts

Databases are used in a variety of contexts, each with specific needs and characteristics. Here are some examples of
databases in different contexts, along with the typical size of databases in these contexts.

## 1. Embedded Systems

### Example

- **IoT (Internet of Things) Devices**: Databases are used to store sensor data, device configurations, and event logs.

### Typical Size

- **Order of magnitude**: Kilobytes (KB) to Megabytes (MB)
- **Example**: An embedded database for a smart thermostat might be a few MB in size to store temperature histories and
  configurations.

## 2. Websites

### Example

- **E-commerce Sites**: Databases store information about products, users, orders, reviews, etc.

### Typical Size

- **Order of magnitude**: Gigabytes (GB) to Terabytes (TB)
- **Example**: A medium-sized e-commerce site may have a database of several hundred GB, while a large site like Amazon
  may have databases of several TB.

## 3. Desktop Applications

### Example

- **Business Management Software**: Databases are used to manage information about customers, products, sales,
  inventory, etc.

### Typical Size

- **Order of magnitude**: Megabytes (MB) to Gigabytes (GB)
- **Example**: Management software for a small business may have a database ranging from a few dozen MB to a few GB.

## 4. Data Analysis

### Example

- **Data Warehousing**: Databases are used to store and analyze large amounts of historical data.

### Typical Size

- **Order of magnitude**: Terabytes (TB) to Petabytes (PB)
- **Example**: A large company may have a data warehouse of several TB for analyzing sales, operations, and performance.

## 5. Mobile Applications

### Example

- **Social Network Applications**: Databases store information about users, messages, friends, photos, etc.

### Typical Size

- **Order of magnitude**: Megabytes (MB) to Gigabytes (GB)
- **Example**: A medium-sized social network application may have a database of several dozen GB to store user
  information and shared content.

## 6. Video Games

### Example

- **Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOs)**: Databases store information about players, characters, inventories,
  scores, etc.

### Typical Size

- **Order of magnitude**: Gigabytes (GB) to Terabytes (TB)
- **Example**: A large-scale MMO game may have a database of several TB to manage player information and game states.

## 7. Financial Systems

### Example

- **Banking Systems**: Databases store information about accounts, transactions, customers, credit histories, etc.

### Typical Size

- **Order of magnitude**: Terabytes (TB) to Petabytes (PB)
- **Example**: A large bank may have databases of several PB to manage financial transactions and customer information.

## Conclusion

Databases are essential in a variety of contexts, each with specific requirements in terms of size and performance. From
a few kilobytes in embedded systems to several petabytes in financial and data analysis systems, databases play a
crucial role in storing, managing, and analyzing information.
