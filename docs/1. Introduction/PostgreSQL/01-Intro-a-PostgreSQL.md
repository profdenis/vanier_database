# Introduction to PostgreSQL

## History of PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL, often called Postgres, is an open-source relational and object-relational database management system. Its development began in 1986 at the University of California, Berkeley, under the POSTGRES project led by Professor Michael Stonebraker[1][2]. The project evolved to become PostgreSQL in 1996, with the addition of SQL support[5].

## Data Model Used

PostgreSQL uses a relational and object-relational data model. This means it supports not only the features of traditional relational databases, such as tables, SQL queries, and transactions, but also advanced features like custom data types, objects, and table inheritance[6][15].

### Comparison of Relational and Object-Relational Models

| Characteristic       | Relational Model                        | Object-Relational Model                                       |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Structure**   | Tables and columns                      | Tables, columns, custom data types, table inheritance         |
| **Query Language**   | Standard SQL                            | SQL with extensions for objects                               |
| **Data Types**       | Standard data types (INT, VARCHAR, etc.)| Standard data types + custom types                            |
| **Object Support**   | No                                      | Yes                                                           |
| **Table Inheritance**| No                                      | Yes                                                           |

## Importance and Support from Major Companies

PostgreSQL is widely used by many large companies and organizations around the world, including:

- **Apple**
- **Cisco**
- **Red Hat**
- **Debian**
- **Instagram**
- **Spotify**

These companies choose PostgreSQL for its robustness, flexibility, and adherence to SQL standards.

## PostgreSQL's Distinctive Features Compared to Other DBMSs

1. **Extensibility**: PostgreSQL allows users to define their own data types, operators, and functions[15].
2. **ACID Transaction Support**: Ensures transaction reliability with atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability properties[15].
3. **SQL Standards Compliance**: PostgreSQL is highly compliant with SQL standards, which facilitates application portability[15].
4. **Complex Query Support**: PostgreSQL supports complex joins, subqueries, materialized views, and more[15].
5. **Advanced Indexing**: Offers several index types (B-tree, Hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN, BRIN) to improve query performance[15].
6. **Security**: Includes advanced security features such as SSL authentication, data encryption, and role-based access control[15].

## License

PostgreSQL is distributed under the PostgreSQL License, a permissive open-source license similar to the MIT License. This allows free use, modification, and distribution, including for commercial applications[1].
