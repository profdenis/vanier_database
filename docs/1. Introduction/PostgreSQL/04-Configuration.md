# PostgreSQL Configuration

## For Windows/Mac

1. Go to [PostgreSQL Download](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads) to download the
   PostgreSQL DBMS.
2. Go
   to [PostgreSQL Installation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/supported-open-source/postgresql/installer/02_installing_postgresql_with_the_graphical_installation_wizard/01_invoking_the_graphical_installer/)
   and follow the instructions to install it.
3. This will install the database server and some other tools to manage databases.
    - The most important for now, the `psql` command and the *PgAdmin* application will be installed at the same time as
      the server.
4. Don't forget to enter a password for the postgres user.
    - If it doesn't ask for a password, it will need to be set from the command line.
    - You will need to use the `psql` command to change the password for the `postgres` user.
    - Otherwise, you will need to reinstall.

### For Linux

1. Follow this guide to install PostgreSQL on
   Ubuntu: [PostgreSQL on Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-postgresql-on-ubuntu-20-04-quickstart).
    - The procedure is very similar for other Linux distributions.
2. Install *PgAdmin* from [here](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/), or through your distribution's package manager.
